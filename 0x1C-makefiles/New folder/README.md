Description

This project introduces you to the fundamentals of make and Makefiles, essential tools in software development. Makefiles define tasks to be executed, allowing for automation of build processes. By completing this project, you'll gain a solid understanding of how to structure Makefiles, define rules, work with variables, and leverage make utility effectively.

The provided examples cover basic concepts such as defining targets and recipes, managing dependencies, and using phony targets. You'll progress from simple "Hello World" prints to more complex tasks like file generation and cleanup.

With clear learning objectives and practical examples, this project equips you with essential skills for managing and automating software builds efficiently.
